# MoneyForward Challenge

This is an implementation of the coding challenge for Money Forward, using Kotlin.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK >= 1.8

### Installing

The application can be started directly from `Application::main`, or using Gradle.

For Gradle, run the following command to start the application:

```
./gradlew run
```

## Code style and choices

For simplicity, no additional libraries were used in this project, except for the Jackson library.

Since there were no strict requirements for the script's output, some custom messages and user prompts were added.

There is minimal error handling, in order to keep the assignment simple.
